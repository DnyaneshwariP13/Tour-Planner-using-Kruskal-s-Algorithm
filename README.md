# Tour-Planner-using-Kruskal-s-Algorithm

This project visualizes UNESCO World Heritage Sites within a specified country and computes a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) to determine the optimal route to visit all the sites. The MST is calculated using Kruskal's algorithm.

Prerequisites:
  Python 3.x
Required libraries:
  pandas
  matplotlib
  geopandas
  shapely
  numpy
  haversine
  scikit-learn
  networkx
  seaborn

Dataset
  The project uses a CSV file containing UNESCO World Heritage Sites data. The file should be named whc-sites(tangibles)-2021.csv and should be placed in the specified directory.


The code provides a visual representation and optimal route for visiting all UNESCO World Heritage Sites within a specified country using Kruskal's algorithm to calculate the MST. This approach ensures minimal travel distance between the sites.
